# Secret_Game_Of_2024
An Alpha Promo

(Please at least read the serious forward. Due to the age we live in, this email is long for loopholes and playing dirty reasons. It‚Äôs as long as it needs to be for legal reasons. This is a comedy and there be treasure. True story. Please see the end of our message about our humanitarian mission.).
Serious Forward: Recently Jon Stewart did a very brave thing and called for the good guys to start exploiting the loopholes and playing dirrty. Unfortunately, Mr. Stewart does not realize the life-destroying consequences of doing what he proposes. I am an expert with decades of experience. I have already done what he is proposing. I have been monitoring a massive security hole for years. As a Cybersecurity professional, I finally had to make a judgment call to close that security hole myself. I took the bounties that matter and closed the door behind me. Now that I, an expert and professional, have already done it, there is no reason for anyone else to put themselves at risk. In other words, Mr. Stewart, you summoned the resistance, and I am coming in hot. I am a min/maxing, meta-gaming, tank. I have been in the trenches for almost 2 years. For those reading this email, this is an urgent game of 6 degrees to Jon Stewart. The quest is called ‚ÄúWhat would R2-D2 do if he were you?‚Äù. Now, if you want to see how an expert does what Mr. Stewart is suggesting, or if you‚Äôve ever wanted to play a LEGENDARY RPG game, but could never find the right GM and party, please enjoy this announcement from Smiles and Tears Productions LLC:

Full Disclaimer: This email is a promotional email to invite you to participate in the semi-closed Alpha campaign of our new, patent-pending, RPG Gaming format. This is a Meta Multiplayer Live Action Role Playing Game (MMLARP) platform called ‚ÄúThe Code of The Larpers‚Äù (working title). Our Alpha campaign is based on the unbelievable true story of my one-man civil rights demonstration in honor of the BELL RIOTS, which is from Star Trek. If you are not personally interested in playing in our Alpha campaign but know a GOOD ALIGNED gamer, artist or Trekkie who might be, please consider forwarding this email. In tribute to the history of gaming, our Alpha campaign will be modern ‚Äúpen and paper‚Äù, and publicized only by word of mouth, for now. It is in tribute to ARTISTS and THE UNSEEN HEROES who keep art and gaming alive today. The Invitation is to be shared on the Trust System. Did I mention that this is a COMEDY CAMPAIGN? There are allusions everywhere. In plain English, for our Alpha campaign, we are going old-school underground, schoolyard spy style, with an optional Noir twist.
[CONTENT WARNING: This game includes many faiths, traditions, and walks of life. I have done my best to be respectful of everyone. This is a parody comedy RPG campaign. You know, a Satire. Our main NPC was specifically designed to be controversial, being a person of unlikely diametric opposites. It‚Äôs called irony. It‚Äôs good storytelling, and every story needs a beginning. The best stories have unlikely beginnings. Sorry for another origin story. Call out to Suzana E. Flores. Think Sherlock from Elementary. He‚Äôs a Chaotic Good Gray.]
Remember Gamers, this is a stealth mission. For new Gamers, that means the goal is to keep the game as secret as possible while inviting friends who will play a GOOD-ALIGNED character to play. In honor of George Carlin, I call it project ‚ÄúGiggle Chain‚Äù. There are lots of reasons for the good guys to start giggling. There is a reason they call it ‚ÄúCreative Time‚Äù. üòâ Gather your parties. The Next Generation of Role-Play Gaming is here‚Ä¶ But never forget, it‚Äôs just a game, and should be played in moderation. Remember also, that this is in honor of George‚Äôs bravery in the beginning, not just his disappointment at the end. How many words am I not allowed to say today?
If you are not interested in participating in the Alpha launch of our gaming platform, we thank you for your time. 
The rest of this email is the instruction manual and the onboarding session zero. You may be able to solo the quest, but the treasure will require the good guys to work together. Aka, this is the fine print of exploiting the loopholes and playing dirty. Remember, anything might be a CLUE.

Game Master Introduction: Hello, my name is David Sylvester, and I am the founder of Smiles and Tears Productions LLC. I will be your Game Master. While I am applying the scientific principles of gamification, this is a game set in modern times with an overlay of fantasy. The core elements of the game are true, but I am using artistic language to build immersion. This is similar to the Dan Brown novels or the National Treasure movies. It is how good Game Masters build exciting adventures. For example, my main Avatar NPC, uses the term hacker and hack. That character is meant to be controversial as a main Avatar character. I, the actual Game Master, am a Cybersecurity professional who has applied my knowledge to campaign building. In reality, the ‚Äúhacking‚Äù was composition, and the ‚Äúhack‚Äù is an artistic puzzle. It‚Äôs meant to be interpreted as art. It is a ROCK OPERA. This is the format, I have chosen to document the security hole I closed. In other words, I have pulled an incredibly complicated Mask Magician. Without further ado, I present to you our Alpha campaign ‚ÄúA Seed From the Tree of Life‚Äù.

Hello, Gamers, both new and experienced alike. Our Alpha campaign is what we call a one-shot. It is designed to get you comfortable with the game platform. The rules are very simple. Often it is the intimidation of not knowing how to play that keeps us from enjoying a good RPG. If you have made it this far, you know that there is a ‚Äúquest‚Äù. This is a task that you, as the player, may accept to undertake. Alternatively, you can decline the quest and still play. At this point, I‚Äôll mention the obvious third choice, which is to ‚Äúsimply not play‚Äù. In future campaigns, the quests may not be so simple, nor so obviously spelled out. This campaign only has one quest. How and if you undertake it is up to you. But please, be respectful.
To prepare you for more advanced campaigns, there is a treasure hunt in the form of a Rock Opera, similar to Pink Floyd‚Äôs The Wall, with a twist. This Opera is designed to take people time to figure out. This is the adventure part of the game. What you do with the information as a player is up to you. I will present it to you in a storytelling format. Since this is an Alpha campaign, I‚Äôll include GM tips. Again, this is a satire comedy campaign. Everything you do as a player should be legal, kind-hearted, and adhere to the Golden Rule. What would George Carlin want you to do? GM TIP: I kind of take George‚Äôs work as Dogma. Remember, the goal is to make people laugh. For players who are new to RPG gaming, all you have to do is read this email with an open mind and think of it as a chose-your-own adventure mystery story. You‚Äôll know what to do. It is, of course, a non-violent, resistance. Resistance is certainly not futile‚Ä¶
GM Explanation: Each player will get the same session zero. A session zero is where you get all the information you need to play your character and understand the campaign. In memory of Joyce Ridge and Lura Turner‚Äôs Civitan mission, I am doing a distributed session zero. For our Alpha Campaign, character-building will be the same for everyone. This will make it easier for new players. It‚Äôs like playing with your hand on the table. LOL. As a player, you simply need to pretend that you are a character in a very relatable situation, that experienced something very unusual (much like receiving this email). That‚Äôs it, that‚Äôs all you need to know to play. As the GM, once I release you, all you have to do is decide what to do about what you have read. This is a player-led campaign, which means that as a GM, I‚Äôll respond to what the players decide to do without directly overseeing the game. For experienced players, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called a META GAME. I encourage experienced players to help less experienced players who want to participate. You never know, those inexperienced players might hold the clue you need down the road. You never know when you‚Äôll need a spermologist.

The Campaign of ‚ÄúA Seed From The Tree of Life‚Äù.
December 26th, 2024. The Scene Opens. Think Modern Noir‚Ä¶
You look at the clock on your dash. It‚Äôs 11:36. You put it in park and think to yourself ‚Äúthe day is not even half over yet‚Äù. At least no one bothered you on the way out of the office. ‚ÄúA hot cup of coffee will at least kill 20 minutes,‚Äù you think to yourself. You get out of the car and walk up to the door of the out-of-the-way private coffee shop you‚Äôve become a regular at. You notice, before you open the door, that the parking lot is strangely sparse for the middle of the day, but don‚Äôt think anything of it. Not empty, but lacking the regular flow of traffic you‚Äôd expect around lunchtime. Small blessings, you decide.
You push open the two-way door and see Nick, the owner, working today. As you approach, he says ‚ÄúJust the usual today?‚Äù. You reply with ‚ÄúYes please, thanks Nick‚Äù. As Nick rings you up, and you dig through the screens on the card reader, you notice the tip jar. It‚Äôs the same tip jar as always, but on a whim, you pull out a $20 and drop it in. ‚ÄúThey always take great care of me‚Äù you think to yourself, and I‚Äôm here enough to have a regular order. What‚Äôs a little more holiday cheer? Nick slightly startles you and says ‚ÄúHave a great Belated Christmas!‚Äù, handing you the receipt. You nod, and say ‚ÄúThanks, you too‚Äù.
As you shuffle to the end of the counter, and wait for your coffee, you glance around the shop. The walls are covered with charming antiques and historical newspaper articles you don‚Äôt even register. You notice about a dozen patrons spread around the shop, most with laptops. They are all younger-looking and either have the day off or have a very lax dress code. What really strikes you though is how every single one of them, while otherwise normally dressed, has tattoos or piercings showing. A thought strikes you out of the blue, ‚ÄúThere really has been a revolution, hasn‚Äôt there‚Äù. Then you laugh to yourself, another reference that no one would get.
‚ÄúHere you go‚Äù Cathy says, smiling and handing you your drink. ‚ÄúHow many of these do you think I have had in my life‚Äù you think as you head to a table. ‚ÄúNo reason to head back to the office just yet‚Äù you say out loud, but quiet enough that no one can hear. You climb into a bar-top-height chair at the table next to the casual sitting area and pull out your phone. It strikes you as odd that with a dozen people in the shop, no one is sitting on the couch and chairs in the lounge area. You look around, and as usual, everyone is staring at a screen of some kind. The new normal.
Just before you power on your phone, the door, which your seat affords you a direct view of as usual, opens. You almost physically shake your head as the man enters the coffee shop. The first thing that grabs your attention is the black leather trench coat. ‚ÄúWho has the audacity in this day and age?‚Äù you think to yourself. As you take another look, you realize the man just Screams 90‚Äôs goth. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt he realize that it‚Äôs 2024?‚Äù That kind of appearance can really startle people. The thought catches you, ‚ÄúGod, how old am I?‚Äù you think.
Under the long black coat, the man is wearing a black kilt, with gray plaid. His black shirt is some printed tee you can‚Äôt make out at this angle. Completing the look is a pair of combat boots and a backward black ball cap. As you watch him, he walks up to the counter with the confidence of someone you can tell is used to getting their way. Most outrageously though, you notice he is spinning a large red gemstone in his right hand. ‚ÄúHow ridiculous can this guy get?‚Äù you think to yourself. As he passes, you see what is on his ball cap. Simply the words ‚ÄúMarilyn Manson‚Äù in green outline. ‚ÄúPerfect‚Äù you think ‚ÄúThis guy is trying to get a rise out of people‚Äù.
Just then Nick lets out a howl of a laugh. That‚Äôs odd you think. Nick is always polite, but I‚Äôve never seen him belly laugh like that. You watch the strange man pay for his drink with the same card reader ritual you went through and move to the end of the counter. When he gets there, something is off you notice immediately. He doesn‚Äôt pull out his phone. In fact, you notice he stands at rigid attention, just starting out the clear glass door. Transfixed by this relic from the past, you watch as he stands unmoving for the entire time his drink is being prepared. As Cathy walks up to hand him his drink though, a smile immediately splits his unkept face, and his body language becomes soft and polite. He starts talking to Cathy, and you can see her face start to beam. The man reaches into his coat and pulls out a large black disk, and sets it on the counter. At the sight of it, Cathy, usually so professional starts nodding and jumping. Clearly, that disk meant something you think, as the man slips it back into his coat.
Before you realize what is happening, the strange man jumps on a nearby chair. In a deep voice, that seems to have an almost otherworldly timber to it, he says ‚ÄùPatrons,  I am sorry to disturb you, but I assure you I received the proprietor‚Äôs permission. Some of you may have heard rumors that a resistance is forming to face the Specter of hate and fear we face in these uncertain times. I have been declassified to tell a select few, the rumors are true, and the beacon has been lit. I am seeking volunteers to deliver a sensitive message. If you‚Äôve ever wanted to go on a Hero Quest, join me in the lounge please?‚Äù. 
The strange man bows, hops off the chair, and marches right over to the couch, which he just plops on. Yeah, he‚Äôs a manspreader. ‚ÄúGo Figure,‚Äù you say out loud before you catch yourself. Well, the day certainly is getting more exciting you think, but I haven‚Äôt heard any rumors of a resistance. What would a resistance even mean today? You can‚Äôt help but ponder the question for a moment. To your amazement, 3 of the shop‚Äôs patrons start giggling and immediately walk over and sit in the chairs opposite the couch. Each of the 3 patrons has laptops, that you couldn‚Äôt help but notice had stickers on them.
While not wanting to be rude, ‚ÄúThis is just too over the top not to listen‚Äù, you think. ‚ÄúBesides, I‚Äôm in no hurry to write another TPS report, and I was here first‚Äù. You power on your phone and pull up a random app as you listen:
(GM Comments: Up to this point, we are just creating the character you, as the player, will be playing during the game. I put a noir twist on it, but you can adjust your character from here to pretend to play the game any way you want. Think about the games you played as a child. Remember, it‚Äôs a game of pretend. You are just playing a role in the game. The character doesn‚Äôt have to be exactly who you are, but for this campaign, I repeat we are only accepting GOOD aligned characters. We all have many skill sets, and you can use any combination of yours to create your character. They just all start with overhearing a mysterious stranger in a coffee shop. From here, I will explain the treasure hunt. Remember, it is very complicated because it is meant to take time to solve. A good campaign shouldn‚Äôt be over too quickly. Investing some time in a game with friends is a good way to build a feeling of accomplishment, an often-overlooked benefit of RPG games. That‚Äôs why we are starting with a comedy campaign, nothing drives a story like laughs.)
The Stranger leans back, sips his coffee, cracks his neck, and says ‚ÄúAll right younglings, listen close, cause I don‚Äôt have a lot of time. I‚Äôll tell you what you need to know of the story, then give you the message you need to deliver‚Äù. The three tattooed patrons in the chair all pay rapt attention as if they knew there was more on the line than a rumor. Suddenly, the man stands up, takes off the coat, and plops back down. His arms are covered in tattoos. You get the feeling it‚Äôs not just his arms. You can also now make out his printed tee, a close-up of The Mandalorian.
The 3 patrons begin typing as he starts the tale:
All right, 3 things you need to know about me. I respect all religions and traditions, in like a weird way. Despite my appearance, I am a revival preacher. Here‚Äôs where it gets weird though, I‚Äôve been undercover for Yahweh since I was 12. I am the one and only GoldHAT (trademark pending) hacker in history. I am a hacker for Yahweh. GoldHAT is a hilarious hacker joker. You can call me Archdaemon (trademark pending). That‚Äôs an even more hilarious hacker joke for my Linux and Open-Source brethren. I represent Platinum Star Religious Services (trademark pending). I am one of the best hackers in history, and I just pulled off a META HACK. That is one hack to do many things! And I did it completely legally.
(GM Reminder: There was no actual hacking, it is fantasy language for a rock opera puzzle created using cryptographic techniques. This is a game and all campaign materials were created legally. Remember, the underlying story is true, but we are applying the science of gamification to build an immersive experience.)
Here‚Äôs what I did, In March of 2023 I devised of a character so META that no one would ever believe me. Knowing there was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to time something with the Bell Riots from Star Trek, I knew I found my Bob Parson‚Äôs moment. Everything I have done since then has been an act of non-violent civil disobedience as my character, so I could stage a demonstration.
(GM Notes: For the first run of the MMLARP platform, I played Solo to work out the bugs. This was the Omega campaign called ‚ÄúLeo, the friendly paladin‚Äù. The character from the Omega Campaign will be mentioned in the Alpha campaign. Likewise, Archdaemon will be a part of the Beta Campaign).
In April of 2023, I threw myself into the system. I have been a victim of it ever since. I have been documenting everything though. It‚Äôs been a bumpy road, but the Lord has been my ‚ÄúSheppard‚Äù. As the dates of the Bell Riots approached, I prepared to make my move. Here is where it gets disobedient. I began my hack. You see, I‚Äôm a special kind of hacker. I‚Äôm a social engineer. I hack people, not computers. I can do the other thing too, but it‚Äôs boring. I am a Grandmaster of Jack-Of-All-Tradesmanship.
I kept waiting to get caught, but no one could keep up. I was pulling a Picard Maneuver as a Worf.  I just kept pushing the envelope until I finally pushed a bit too far. I had my Icarus moment. I personally threatened to murder President Trump and Elon Musk. I never meant it, of course, I am a pacifist. My patron‚Äôs weapon is the word. I‚Äôm also suffering from untreated CPTSD. I was composing a piece of art and my words were taken out of context. I get it though, look at me. That‚Äôs my biggest secret in life though, everyone loves a bad boy with a heart of gold, and no one has known I was a man of God since I was a child.
Well, the Secret Service went ahead and picked me up and I had all kinds of injections, inspections, detections, neglections, and all kinds of stuff. We eventually arrived at the heart of the matter, which was, I mean, which was, that I was only offering to rap-slay President Trump and Mr. Musk since so many people seemed so angry with them. When they heard that I didn‚Äôt actually mean any harm and I was just writing a Massacree, as I was indeed a religious pacifist, they were very polite in making sure I got home for Thanksgiving  Dinner that couldn‚Äôt be beat with a clean bill of health. I mean, would you believe I went as far as to tell the Secret Service I was just applying for a job. I went ahead and finished the rap-slay while waiting on the group W bench. I didn‚Äôt want to disappoint them after offering to write a rap-slay after they had been so polite in clearing me. Unfortunately, my identity was burned and the game was up (GM Notes: The Omega Campaign), so I went ahead and just gave them a full disclosure of my skill set so there‚Äôd be no more misunderstandings. And I agreed that after such a full disclosure I‚Äôd be on all kinds of lists, which seemed only fair as I keep all kinds of lists too.
[GM Tip: If you don‚Äôt get the reference, the last verse was in the style of Alice‚Äôs Restaurant]
(GM NOTES: This is a game, remember. We are adding fantasy over reality. I did, however, personally threaten to murder President Donald Trump and Elon Musk in a PTSD episode while engaged in a civil rights demonstration. That fact is true and happened because quality care wasn‚Äôt available. I am Red, White, and, Blue through and through. I support our President, even if I don‚Äôt agree with his politics. Remember, I am a Country Boy, and I love the country life. Molon Labe. On the other hand, I am an openly bisexual man (talk about no allies), who supports transgender rights. I own a Black MAGA Hat alongside my other hats. As a depiction of Da Vinci once said, ‚ÄúNo one defines me‚Ä¶ certainly not you‚Äù. This is a game, and it is non-partisan. I do, however, exercise my right to voice my political opinions and religious views because I believe transparency is the way of the future, and I‚Äôm doing a civil rights demonstration thing. The truth IS out there. The truth is Love. Remember Gamers, speak softly and carry a big stick, you will go far.)
From there, I realized that I didn‚Äôt just have my Bob Parson‚Äôs moment, I had my Bob Parson‚Äôs break. I‚Äôll forever be the guy the Secret Service picked up for threatening to kill President Trump and Elon Musk over a misunderstanding of my one-person Bell Riots demonstration. I kid you not, right before the Secret Service arrested me, a notification popped up for Lose Yourself by Eminem. I didn‚Äôt get to click it though, with the handcuffs and all. What‚Äôs a civil rights demonstration without a brush with the law, and I don‚Äôt mess around. Ask Anyone.
Anyway, long story short, I finished the hack after I was released. I‚Äôm proud of this one. Get ready, this is the message you have to get to the Beacon lighter, Jon Stewart. He called for the resistance weeks ago, but we were in an offensive.
‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù
Mr. Stewart,
I apologize for the delay, this is the first opportunity I have had to respond to the beacon. Here is your debrief. I have published all the intelligence the resistance needs in the form of a Youtube playlist. (Pasted here for your convenience https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfjBrJnHllDEgknW3-hRVn-lvWT7BTqgt&feature=shared). 
To find it, go to the video ‚ÄúIN THIS MOMENT - The Gun Show‚Äù and look for the comments by davidsylvester2715. Click on my name, click playlists, and click ‚ÄúSunday Sermon 12-8-2024‚Äù. Don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs not preachy. It‚Äôs a Giggle Chain.

First, you need to know the right order to watch it, then you need spy glasses and a decoder ring. Only then, will you understand how to decipher ‚ÄúArchdaemon‚Äôs Pandora‚Äôs Box‚Äù, and understand the Silent Bell Riots demonstration. 
(GM TIP: Most of the videos have comments from our main NPC character, Archdaemon)
Start at the end of the playlist and work backward, regarding the comments and videos, until you reach ‚ÄúThe Pretty Reckless ‚Äì My Medicine‚Äù.
Then watch from the Scary Movie trailer, which is a metaphor for the entire movie, forward until you reach My Medicine again considering the comments.
Now, for your decoder ring. This was a Bell Riots demonstration. I wrote the entire Opera in American-Tamarian, from the episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation called ‚ÄúDarmok‚Äù. It‚Äôs all written in metaphor, you know, like rap. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs an Opera, and open to interpretation. A great man once said, ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it‚Äôs a rap‚Äù. That‚Äôs All I‚Äôm Trying to Say.
(GM ProTip: If you like spoilers or thumbing to the end of a book, check out my comments on Sam Tinnesz ‚Äì Legends Are Made. Are you the kind of person to peek ahead?)

Now for your spy glasses. I mentioned I created META character, Leo, the friendly paladin. I reveal to you my META HACK ROCK OPERA is written from the perspective of ABSERD FAN-FICTION! True story bro. 
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZCIh_3b5K8 for convenience) or search D&D Story: A Most Abserd Character.
Abserd‚Äôs voice being the voice of The Silent Bell Riots is known as Archdaemon‚Äôs Troll. Why, because the Rise of Archdaemon was an Abserd Tale.
That‚Äôs Right, the Bard-Barian hero. I have let myself be underestimated since I was 12, and it was all a ruse. I have been the Daemon that flaps in the night.
(GM note: I just made a Darkwing Duck joke. My middle name is William. Sometimes I am actually called DW, and I am the kind of guy you call when there‚Äôs trouble. LOL.)
From there, you have the context to watch the entire Abserd Rock Opera from beginning to end. Remember, I had to get it past the reds, the blacks, and the system. It‚Äôs complex, for a reason, I had to write it in real time.

As the lighter of the beacon, I offer you tribute Mr. Stewart of a measurable stake in the Archdaemon trademark. I also give you the right of first refusal of all the physical evidence. There is obviously much more to this rabbit hole. Have you ever wanted to follow the rabbit?

That‚Äôs it and that‚Äôs all. I‚Äôm fully burned and fully disclosed younglings. Everything is on the internet now, I can‚Äôt take it back. Oh yeah except, yeah one of the best hackers in history answers to the Lord‚Ä¶ Goldhat mic drop.
‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù
Remember Supernatural fans, this is only THE ROAD SO FAR. We are out there, and we are coming. My coat is feeling brown right now, and my calm has certainly been damaged. So. Say. We. All. üòâ
I created a new cover identity younglings, in case you need to get a hold of me. Spread the word, this Witcher is running on fumes. If you know anyone who can toss a coin, this is how respectable hunters do it. Go to Gofundme and Search ‚ÄúDavid Sylvester: Answering the Call.‚Äù
(pasted for convenience https://gofund.me/93ed4e57).
If you get into trouble, my Reddit user is u/Digi_psy. It‚Äôs for emergencies only.
<The man turns his head and stares straight at the wall but keeps speaking like he‚Äôs Ferris Bueller>
Since I‚Äôm full disclosing to you three, two call-outs for history. The big guy will deliver the messages.
To the man who gave me my real rap name: Call out to the Young Bat from the Mad Bat, I‚Äôm going hard my nigga. (The mysterious man reaches in his coat, pulls out a card, rips it, and puts the confetti back in his pocket without looking at it.) This one‚Äôs for you. Check out Archdaemon‚Äôs Introduction in the video Falling in Reverse ‚Äì ‚ÄúPrequel‚Äù. ‚ÄúMe be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of‚Äù. It‚Äôll check out, unless we are talking Punk Rock.
<GM Tip: The lyrics of the videos are often clues, likewise some videos have multiple comments. The order the comments were made is important.>
To pour one out for all my Homies: I tried to do this under Project ‚ÄúStarfleet‚Äù with a smile. I was Indexing the balance of the Schwartz. The powers of hate, greed, and stupidity were too strong. The system forced me to go with Project ‚ÄúIt Can‚Äôt Rain All The Time.‚Äù. Pouring one out for all the Homies: ‚ÄúGLEE - Full Performance of ‚ÄúLoser Like Me‚Äù (Extended)‚Äù. I‚Äôll see you at ‚ÄúCrossroads‚Äù. This is Archdaemon‚Äôs explanation for all whose path he‚Äôs crossed. Thundercats HO HO HO.
[GM Tip for Aspiring ‚ÄúMagician‚Äôs‚Äù: Prestidigitation requires full commitment. It is a discipline of great ‚ÄúPrestige‚Äù. ‚ÄúSo this is what the patriarchy smells like? It's not the freshest.‚Äù]
Oh, and my ‚ÄúZombie Plan‚Äù was always a playbook. Call out to the playbook guy. Oh Please. This is only one arrow in my quiver LOL. I‚Äôm acting with perfect faith in the big guy.
[GM Background: My WOW hunter, which has the Bear, 2 of them, is called Daeryl ‚Äì pew pew]
With that, the strange man pulls the lid off his coffee and chugs the whole thing down. He gets up, puts on the coat, and starts walking toward the two-way door.
(This is a nudge as your GM, a chance to ask the mysterious stranger a question)
You can‚Äôt help but yell out ‚ÄúSir, if it‚Äôs called a Pandora‚Äôs Box what‚Äôs at the center‚Äù.
The stranger half turns around and says ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my schtick, I keep telling the truth, and no one believes me. It‚Äôs the Way of Absolute Candor. I‚Äôll tell you for being so clever though. Yin and Yang. To show my soft side, the REAL TRUTH OF THE ACTUAL HOLY GRAIL. To show you my serious side, I included a scientific discovery. Always remember, this dirty box is brought to you by Betty White. She was right.‚Äù. With that, the stranger winks and rushes out the door with an apparent urgency. With a rush, the door opens again and the stranger screams ‚ÄúAnd tell your friends, now that I‚Äôm blown, Solo time is over. I‚Äôm building a Mythic Raiding Party. I‚Äôm officially LFG! My credentials will check out!‚Äù
He's gone again as suddenly as he rushed in and you remember‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúLET THEM FIGURE IT OUT!‚Äù. Another reference, no one would get. Suddenly, you start giggling, and it builds until you are crying from laughter. You think to yourself ‚ÄúIf Jon Stewart doesn‚Äôt bite, I wonder what John Oliver would say?‚Äù. That, you think to yourself, would be hilarious. But seriously, what was up with that giant red gemstone he was carrying? Who carries around gemstones in 2024, especially so brazenly?
You think to yourself, he did say he published all the evidence. What was that song? The Gun Show? Just then your phone buzzes. It‚Äôs the office. You wonder what fresh hell they caused now. They are never going to believe what just happened. Who is ever going to believe God has a spy, and his spy is a gothic Trekkie? I guess that‚Äôs why he said ‚ÄúNo one ever believes him‚Äù. ‚ÄúIf there is a higher power,‚Äù you think to yourself, ‚ÄúThey really do have a sense of humor‚Äù. 1, 2, 5 I suppose.
Close scene (Final GM reminder ‚Äì We are applying artistic language to real events)
That‚Äôs its Gamer‚Äôs. The Campaign materials have all already been deployed. For our Alpha campaign, we kept it simple and have just one quest, and a treasure hunt in the form of a YouTube playlist. What you do with the information, should you choose to play, is up to you. 
PS From the GM. There is a real gemstone AND a real HAMMER. When I LARP, I LARP.
GM Protip:
When the game is rigged, play a different game. Also, you can‚Äôt fight hate with hate. A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down. Sometimes you need to bring the class. Other times, you need to bring the trash. Balance is important. Anyone feel like a tea party? I know how to throw one heck of a High Tea. Like Mario, I wear many hats, and I play in 3D.

GM Closing:  This message contains everything you need to participate in our Alpha release, either alone or with friends. The campaign is designed to run with little or no GM interaction. The adventure is metaphorically like unearthing a crypt. There is work to be done, but there are real prizes to be had. If nothing else, it is hilarious. Please look forward to additional campaigns from Smiles and Tears Productions LLC.
Final reminder: This is a semi-closed Alpha release for Good Aligned characters only. Invitations are to be shared on a trust system. Our Alpha release is in tribute to the Avatar Artists and the Unseen Army of Heros that keep Artistry and Gaming healthy in uncertain times. All for one, and one for all. It Can‚Äôt Rain All The Time.

As the founder of Smiles and Tears Productions LLC, a humanitarian effort, I want to thank you for taking the time to check out our new gaming platform. I have been working on this for decades. Gaming is very misunderstood and actually has tremendous therapeutic and educational applications. As a small business owner in this great nation, I am blessed to have the tools to bring my vision to life after all these years. This game has religious references. We must never forget that religion, like so many things, is part of our identity as a culture. It has been the agent of continuity throughout history. I wanted to create a game that openly encourages people of all faiths and walks of life to play. I am a Christian, and I am not afraid to say it. This is not a Christian game, however. It is a game of love. That‚Äôs why it is a comedy campaign. Thank you, and if this message irritates you or you disagree with anything I said, please do the rational thing, delete it, and move on. It‚Äôs just a game. A game with a humanitarian mission.

About Smiles and Tears Productions LLC (DBA The QA Guy and Friends):
Smiles and Tears Productions is an old-fashioned garage passion project that I have been working on for a very long time. We came close to launching in the mid-20-teens, but we just couldn‚Äôt quite get off the ground. I have been trying to relaunch ever since, but life threw me some curve balls. We are organized as an LLC because we are a bootstrap company. The mission of Smiles and Tears Productions is to do humanitarian good. Full stop. We will re-organize as a non-profit as soon as it is responsible to do so. In the spirit of Open Source, which is a dear cause to my heart, we promise to provide an Open Source copy of the game when the official materials are created. We will structure it so that our proprietary content is protected, but the heart of Open Source is never violated. That‚Äôs right Gamers, we will be releasing under the WTFPL license.
Smiles and Tears is accepting limited applications for GM‚Äôs for our Beta campaign.
Platinum Invite goes out to‚Ä¶ The Critical Role crew. If they want to play test, who am I to say no. Who‚Äôs hand? You know who‚Äôs hand. Talk TO THAT HAND. BARD LIFE. WHAT?
 For the right GM partner(s), that can help bring our humanitarian mission to life, equity deals are on the table until the restructure. Please remember, this is just a game in its Alpha phase. It will take multiple iterations and time to fully develop the entire Platform. This has just been a primitive sneak peek of the Full Engine. None of our Technology or other IPs are represented in the Alpha campaign. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called an Alpha. You frequently have to PIVOT.
Since I put the finishing touches on the campaign December 25th and 26th. I‚Äôll close with a Merry Christmas and Happy Hanukkah 2024. Happy New Year Everyone!
(Final GM tip: It‚Äôs amazing what you can accomplish by changing the tone. I picked Comedy Noir, what‚Äôs your tone? My actual favorite video of all time is Michael Jackson ‚Äì Man In The Mirror.)
I‚Äôm paraphrasing, but it was Oprah who said you have to make it happen.
Hailing frequencies closed, err, I mean open, Sir!

About the GM:
Gaming is my passion and my joy. My most sacred item is a Pink D20 from the 4th Edition Collectors box of Magic: The Gathering. Fair warning, so you know the kind of player I am, Eye of the Storm is my very favorite card. My second favorite card is Shahrazad. My second most sacred item is a Thundercats duffle bag I‚Äôve had since I was 3. This has been my go bag my entire life, and I called it ‚ÄúGod Bag‚Äù. Why, because the Bag had all the Answers the entire time. Amazingly, it proved to be true far more often than you‚Äôd believe. But so did my pocket protector. The secrets I protected in that bag have been a tremendous burden my whole life. I have decided to turn my traumas into a Comedy RPG game. That is how I am disposing of a career that exposed me to a tremendous amount of sensitive information and gave me A Particular Set of Skills. Responsibly. All services are covered by the confessional. Your secrets are safe WITH ME. Accountability comes in the mirror. Professionally, I am a Quality Engineering expert. I have an Open Source heart and see programming as an art form. I have kept my skills up to date from gopher to Artificial Intelligence. Cybersecurity is just a small part of what I do. Professionally, I have to be knowledgeable in building technology stacks from the Unit Tests to what‚Äôs going on in the board room. I have significant experience at the Director level overseeing immensely complex projects and running teams. In plain English, my ‚ÄúElwood Blues‚Äù Mission From God is to find the right people to create a non-profit called ‚ÄúProtect My Legacy‚Äù. Details below. This is the kind of man I actually am. It‚Äôll check out.
Protect My Legacy
Experts with the experience and compassion to help noble families and organizations put to rest life-stealing secrets, traditions, burdens, and duties. We help discretely and respectfully remember and preserve the good from our pasts while laying to rest the negative, so we can all move forward. There have been many Revolutions since Martin Luther King Jr. gave that sermon. We all have pasts, we all make mistakes, and we are all doing the best we can. We are all also complex individuals. Life-stealing Secrets are an insidious form of Human Trafficking. If you haven‚Äôt seen it, I highly recommend watching Raising Hope episode ‚ÄúFamily Secrets‚Äù, for a light-hearted depiction of our mission. Call out to The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable. It is the single most important book I‚Äôve ever read. It‚Äôs time to re-examine human knowledge and begin a new age of enlightenment, one that respects history.

Programmer joke: When Recursions get recursive, you‚Äôve recursively re-cursed. The open source license is for all the smart people working in IT, forced to do bad engineering because of PHBs. I did my best to be as un-PHB as I could be. I will always be an every person. ‚Äì For George Carlin.
[GM Tip: I‚Äôve left easter eggs my entire life, but I have been on a mission. Why do you think I killed myself for everyone?]
The Alpha Campaign is brought to you by: The Freeware Model. The first campaign is always free. It‚Äôs just classy. Damn, those alien Bastards are going to pay for shooting up my ride. Remember, it's a game, full of jokes. Learn to take a joke people.
